Resource classes are always request scoped, therefore ...
- have uriInfo injected into resource-constructor
- have UriBuilderHolder injected from Guice side into resource-constructor, set builder inside constructor
- have UriBuilderHolder injected into templates, to use builder in templates 
OwnerUriBuilder.fromUriInfo(uriInfo);
