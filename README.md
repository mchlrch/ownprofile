the ownprofile project
==========

a step towards a social web, where the individuals freedom and privacy are fundamental.

with ownprofile, the socialgraph is de-centralized and the individual user has full control over its own part of the graph - unlike in todays mainstream socialmedia,
where the graph is owned and exploited by commercial entities and not the individual user.

ownprofile limits itself to the handling of (meta-)information concerning the communication endpoints/outlets
(e.g. email adress, mastodon handle, keys, etc.).

### Status
incubation, experimental

### Build & Run
For instructions on how to build and run the software, refer to the [README of org.ownprofile.node](tree/master/org.ownprofile.node).
